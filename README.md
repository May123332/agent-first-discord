# agent-first-discord

This project builds on the Vesktop source code (see https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop) to create an experimental Discord client designed for agent-first communication. The goal is to allow users to choose whether a local large language model or an online model should be used when launching the application. Instead of a single human interacting with a language model, this client connects the model to shared channels so it can talk with multiple people at once.

More details and instructions will be added as development progresses.
